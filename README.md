# Question-Answering-Engine-with-Transformers
The aim of this thesis is the creation of a question answering engine over the Wikidata knowledge graph. 
This thesis is based on the entity span and relation prediction for whichever question. The models for these predictions are implemented through the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to perform Span Entity and Relation prediction on questions posed in natural English.
